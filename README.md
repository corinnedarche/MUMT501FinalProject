# MUMT501 Final Project: Onset Detection

This repository contains my final project on Onset Detection for MUMT501: Digital Signal Processing (McGill University, Winter 2022). This project involved research on onset detection algorithms, as well as an implementation of Scherrer and Depalle's (2014) onset detection algorithm for percussive sounds.
